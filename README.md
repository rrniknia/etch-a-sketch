# etch-a-sketch

A simple webpage that allows you to enter a number, generating a grid with the width and height of that number, which can be drawn on with the user's cursor.
In this project, I:

* used CSS to create a webpage
* dynamically added elements on a page with a function in JS
* dynamically added event listeners to created elements with JS
* used variables in conjunction with div ids to change color
